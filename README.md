# ex_checker

## Overwiew
This is a python script that I wrote to check if the students submitted the exercises or not in the TSI system.

## Usage example

`$ python ex_checker.py`  
`Input the path to the folder wich has the uploaded ex files (ex:"./uploaded").`   
`path : ./uploaded-2 `  
`Input the Exercise number that you want to check (ex: "Ex1").  `  
`Ex number : Ex1  `   
`Input the date of the sheet "std6_YenClass" that you want to overwrite. (ex: YYYY-MM-DD)  `  
`Sheet date: 2018-06-24  `  
`The new ./std6_YenClass_2018-06-24.xlsx file was created  `
